This is a resubmission.

* I have extended the package description.
* I have removed `\dontrun{}` in `orcid()` and `PlumeQuarto`'s examples.
* Note that when used, `<<-` modifies the environment of the parent function, not the global environment.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
